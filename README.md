# AWMCollectionData - A public, downloadable csv file of The Warhol's collection data. (WIP)

## Welcome to the Andy Warhol Musuem's Collection Dataset. In an attempt to make our collection accessible, to adhere to current trends regarding Open Access, and to aid researchers and art enthusiasts who are interested in our collection, we are making our collection data public and downloadable as a csv file.

## In this repository, you will find data that pertains to all accessioned objects in our collection, a description of the data, and some guidelines on using the data. Please take a minute to familiarize yourself with the structure and guidelines below.

Your feedback and input is always welcome. If you’ve got questions or suggestions, please send them to us with “AWM Dataset” in the subject header.

# Data Structure
This data release includes nearly all accessioned works in our database. It contains basic data for each work.

The data is released as a CSV dump. Please note that both the CSV may contain newlines (\n) within any text field, and they often appear within the provenance, medium and credit_line fields.


# Usage Guidelines
The dataset contains the data and metadata of approximately 28269 objects in the collection of Carnegie Museum of Art and another approximately 59031 records from the Teenie Harris Archive in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. We are providing this data without restrictions for all to enjoy. We've got a few guidelines, but we've worked hard to make this dataset as open and explorable as possible.

Please contact us if you have any questions.

# Lack of Images in the Data Set
Images are not covered under the same license as the dataset.

If you would like to license images of artworks in AWM’s collection, please contact the Rights and Reproduction Department: mailto:rights@warhol.org

# Dataset Integrity
Collections data is provided for the purposes of exploration, education, experimentation, and fun, but it is to be used at your own risk.

Please be aware that the dataset contains incomplete data and/or errors. AWM staff does not guarantee or provide curatorial approval for these records.

At AWM, research is always ongoing, and so our understanding of these objects and their metadata are subject to change. This dataset will be updated on a regular basis to reflect our current best understanding of the object. You are advised to use, or update to, the most current version of the dataset for best accuracy.

If you have identified errors in the dataset, or have additional information to add, we welcome your feedback! Please contact us at mailto:womackb@warhol.org.

Thanks!
